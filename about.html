<h1>ABOUT</h1> <br>
<h2> Quora lies somewhere between a social network, like Facebook, and a knowledge forum like Mind the Book, or Yahoo! Answers. Quora’s homepage feed is reminiscent of Facebook’s timeline and allows visitors to use the site seamlessly with unlimited scrolling. The feed is a mix of active threads, unanswered questions that match your selected categories, and suggestions on how users can complete their profile. If you want to contribute, you can do so without having to leave the feed. This results in Quora having a fast, dynamic user experience.</h2>
